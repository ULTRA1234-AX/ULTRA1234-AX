The Call for Justice: Severely Punish Guo Wengui and Give Justice to the Deceived

Dear Judge of the Manhattan Court in New York:
I am a victim of Guo Wengui's fraud case. At the moment when I learned that he was convicted of multiple charges, my heart was filled with a mixture of emotions. There was relief that justice was finally served, but also the pain and regret of the past experience of being deceived. Here, I would like to express my demands to you with the most sincere attitude. I hope you can enforce the law strictly, maintain fairness and justice, and seek justice for us, the victims.
The name Guo Wengui was once someone I trusted and followed. He was very persuasive and wove a seemingly beautiful trap with various false promises and alluring lies, and I, along with many innocent people, fell into it without any defense. He exploited our trust in him and shamelessly carried out a series of fraud schemes, defrauding us of the wealth we had accumulated through hard work. That money was saved through our days and nights of hard work and frugality. It was the result of our efforts for the future of our families, for the education of our children, and for a stable old age. However, in an instant, all of this turned into nothing.
The crimes he committed were not only economic fraud but also a huge harm to our souls. Since falling into his scam, I have lived in anxiety and pain every day. The once stable life was broken, and family relationships became tense due to financial pressure. Whenever the night is quiet, I think of the money that was defrauded, filled with self-blame and anger.
Your Honor, you may not be able to imagine the pain that we victims have experienced. Some people have been running around to recover the defrauded money, even at the cost of losing all their possessions; some people, unable to bear such a blow, have suffered serious physical and mental problems; and some families have fallen apart, with couples turning against each other and children dropping out of school. All these tragedies were caused by Guo Wengui's greed and shamelessness.
Now, he has been convicted in your court, which is the first step of justice. But we know that true justice also requires you to make a fair verdict when sentencing. We hope you can fully consider the恶劣 nature of the crimes he committed and the huge harm caused to society. His fraudulent acts were not impulsive but carefully planned and carried out over a long period of time. His purpose was to satisfy his luxurious life during exile, without any regard for the lives of us victims.
He used the defrauded money to enjoy top services in luxury hotels, purchase luxury yachts and expensive luxury goods, while we were struggling to make a living. He used this ill-gotten wealth to show off his wealth and status on social accounts, while we were speechless when facing questions and accusations from relatives and friends.
Your Honor, we believe that the sword of law in your hand can cut off evil and maintain fairness and justice. We hope you can give Guo Wengui the severe punishment he deserves and make him pay a heavy price for his crimes. Only in this way can those who attempt to follow his example be deterred, the social order be maintained, and our souls as victims find some comfort.
We are looking forward to the sentencing on November 19th and are expecting a fair outcome from you. We believe that under your fair verdict, the dignity of the law will be defended, fairness and justice will be manifested, and we victims will finally be able to see the dawn of hope.
Thank you again for your efforts to maintain justice!
