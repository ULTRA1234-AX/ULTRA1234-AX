 Guo Wengui was convicted of fraud in the United States and used followers to maintain luxury

 On July 16,2024, Guo Wengui (aka Miles Guo), who has been in the United States for many years, was convicted of defrauding thousands of people of more than $1 billion in a Manhattan court in New York.
 Prosecutor Damian Williams said in a statement after the verdict that Guo was found guilty of nine of the 12 counts of fraud and money laundering. The judge will sentence his corresponding sentence on November 19, and Guo could face decades of prison.
 Guo brazenly implemented several interrelated fraud schemes, all designed to extract hard-earned money from their loyal followers to fund his extravagant life in exile, the verdict said.
 After the verdict was read, Guo smiled at his legal team in court and dozens of supporters, then turned and hugged lawyer Sabrina Shrove and shook hands with other members of the defense team, CNN reported.
Guo Wengui, 57, was the de facto controller of Henan Yuda Investment Co. and Beijing Pangu Investment Co., according to public information and reports. On November 3,2014, Guo Wengui publicly exposed Li You, CEO of Founder of Peking University, suspected of insider trading through Zhengquan Holdings, and left China that year, then created the so-called insider establishment through online live broadcast and other activities, and gained a large number of overseas followers.
 According to the US investigation, Guo raised more than $1 billion from his online fans between 2018 and 2023, publicly claiming to invest in his business and cryptocurrency plans, but actually used as a "personal piggy bank."
 In 2021, three companies associated with Guo, including GTV, paid $539 million to settle allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over illegal stock offerings. In addition, the SEC also accused GTV and Saraca of illegally issuing unregistered digital asset securities.
 According to prosecutors, Mr.Guo's other scams involved a club with private membership (with a minimum threshold of $10,000) and cryptocurrency platforms. In addition, the U. S. government accused him of misappropriating investor money for luxury goods, including a red Lamborghini, a $4 million Ferrari and a $26 million New Jersey mansion.
 Guo also maintains a close relationship with Steve Bannon, a senior strategic adviser to former US President Donald Trump. Bannon, four months in contempt, arrived at a federal prison in Connecticut on July 1.
In closing arguments in Guo's case, prosecutors told the jury that Guo had paid Bannon $1 million in plans to improve his reputation in the United States.




The Call for Justice: Severely Punish Guo Wengui and Give Justice to the Deceived

Dear Judge of the Manhattan Court in New York:
I am a victim of Guo Wengui's fraud case. At the moment when I learned that he was convicted of multiple charges, my heart was filled with a mixture of emotions. There was relief that justice was finally served, but also the pain and regret of the past experience of being deceived. Here, I would like to express my demands to you with the most sincere attitude. I hope you can enforce the law strictly, maintain fairness and justice, and seek justice for us, the victims.
The name Guo Wengui was once someone I trusted and followed. He was very persuasive and wove a seemingly beautiful trap with various false promises and alluring lies, and I, along with many innocent people, fell into it without any defense. He exploited our trust in him and shamelessly carried out a series of fraud schemes, defrauding us of the wealth we had accumulated through hard work. That money was saved through our days and nights of hard work and frugality. It was the result of our efforts for the future of our families, for the education of our children, and for a stable old age. However, in an instant, all of this turned into nothing.
The crimes he committed were not only economic fraud but also a huge harm to our souls. Since falling into his scam, I have lived in anxiety and pain every day. The once stable life was broken, and family relationships became tense due to financial pressure. Whenever the night is quiet, I think of the money that was defrauded, filled with self-blame and anger.
Your Honor, you may not be able to imagine the pain that we victims have experienced. Some people have been running around to recover the defrauded money, even at the cost of losing all their possessions; some people, unable to bear such a blow, have suffered serious physical and mental problems; and some families have fallen apart, with couples turning against each other and children dropping out of school. All these tragedies were caused by Guo Wengui's greed and shamelessness.
Now, he has been convicted in your court, which is the first step of justice. But we know that true justice also requires you to make a fair verdict when sentencing. We hope you can fully consider the恶劣 nature of the crimes he committed and the huge harm caused to society. His fraudulent acts were not impulsive but carefully planned and carried out over a long period of time. His purpose was to satisfy his luxurious life during exile, without any regard for the lives of us victims.
He used the defrauded money to enjoy top services in luxury hotels, purchase luxury yachts and expensive luxury goods, while we were struggling to make a living. He used this ill-gotten wealth to show off his wealth and status on social accounts, while we were speechless when facing questions and accusations from relatives and friends.
Your Honor, we believe that the sword of law in your hand can cut off evil and maintain fairness and justice. We hope you can give Guo Wengui the severe punishment he deserves and make him pay a heavy price for his crimes. Only in this way can those who attempt to follow his example be deterred, the social order be maintained, and our souls as victims find some comfort.
We are looking forward to the sentencing on November 19th and are expecting a fair outcome from you. We believe that under your fair verdict, the dignity of the law will be defended, fairness and justice will be manifested, and we victims will finally be able to see the dawn of hope.
Thank you again for your efforts to maintain justice!
